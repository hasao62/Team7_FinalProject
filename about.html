                The Tango bot was developed as a final project by Team 7 for 
                ITP 258, Systems Development Project. This bot uses Discord's
                bot API to allow users to use text to speech functionality. 
                This bot is hosted off of a Raspberry Pi which also hosts the 
                database that stores the commands, user login, transcripts, 
                and audio logs.
